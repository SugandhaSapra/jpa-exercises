1.)
Optional is being removed because it makes the association mandatory.

2.) Two select queries are fired because entitymanager.find() is calling toString method. In toString method employee is calling department.
So 2nd select query is retrieving the department details.

3.)
Employee :

department_id	bigint(20)	YES	MUL
id	bigint(20)	NO	PRI
name	varchar(255)	YES
salary	bigint(20)	NO

Department :
id	bigint(20)	NO	PRI
name	varchar(255)	YES

4.)
inverse side : Department
Owning side :Employee

5.) 2 queries are fired
54.356 [main] DEBUG org.hibernate.SQL - select department0_.id as id1_0_0_, department0_.name as name2_0_0_ from departments department0_ where department0_.id=?
54.362 [main] DEBUG org.hibernate.SQL - select employees0_.department_id as departme4_1_0_, employees0_.id as id1_1_0_, employees0_.id as id1_1_1_, employees0_.department_id as departme4_1_1_, employees0_.name as name2_1_1_, employees0_.salary as salary3_1_1_ from employees employees0_ where employees0_.department_id=?

6.)
If we remove mappedBy, a new departments_employees table is created. While inserting data to employee table, department_id
   is not populated. Since, the bidrectional association is broken and the inverse side
   doesn't maps to the owning side.
